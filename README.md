# Data Structures: Stack and Deque

This repository contains implementations of the stack and deque data structures with error handling. Both structures support a set of commands to manipulate their elements and print appropriate responses.

## Stack Implementation

### Supported Commands
- `push n` - Add the number `n` to the stack. Prints `ok`.
- `pop` - Remove the last element from the stack. Prints the value of the element or `error` if the stack is empty.
- `back` - Print the value of the last element without removing it. Prints `error` if the stack is empty.
- `size` - Print the number of elements in the stack.
- `clear` - Clear the stack. Prints `ok`.
- `exit` - Print `bye` and terminate the program.
